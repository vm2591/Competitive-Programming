The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N input A[i].
The third line of each test case contains L and R, L is left index of array and R is right index of array.

Output:

Print the modified array.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
