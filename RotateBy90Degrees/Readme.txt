Given an square matrix, turn it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, where N is the size of the square matrix.The second line of each test case contains NxN space separated values of the matrix M.

Output:

Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the rotated array.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 50

Example:

Input
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Output
3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7
